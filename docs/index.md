## Getting started

This getting started guide will assume you already have a DOS machine, with a packet driver loaded, and a Windows based machine as a client.

1. Copy `disksrv.exe` to your DOS machine, and run it from DOS.
2. Launch `disksrv-client.exe` on your Windows machine.
3. Connect to the DOS machine by hostname or IP address.
4. Use the GUI to read a floppy disk, to validate the connection is working as intended. This may take several minutes on real hardware.
