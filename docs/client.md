# disksrv - Client

## Requirements

* A .Net 4.0 environment, capable of running WinForms based programs. This should include recent installations of Mono.
* A TCP/IP network
* Network access to the disksrv host.

## Limitations

The client currently only supports connecting to one server at a time.

## Usage

Extract the client to a directory, somewhere on your filesystem. Run the `disksrv-client.exe` file, and the GUI will launch.

First you must connect to your disksrv host, you can specify either an IP address or a hostname.
