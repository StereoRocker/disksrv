v1.0 - Initial release

####################
# PACKET STRUCTURE #
####################

The structure of a request and response packet, are actually identical.
The only difference, is the meaning of the first byte.

The first byte, for a request, is the command number. For a response, this
is the returned status for the request.

typedef struct {
	uint16_t  reqstat;		// Request number, or response status
	uint16_t datalen;
	uint8_t  data[];
} packet_t;

######################
# INITIAL CONNECTION #
######################

Upon initial connection, the server will send 4 bytes.

The first two are a magic number, 0x64 0x73 ('DS' in hex).
The third byte signifies the major version of the program, and the fourth
signifies the minor version. Minor revisions will be protocol-compatible.
Major revisions may not be.

#######
# CHS #
#######

The CHS datatype is used often in requests/responses. It is defined as 4
bytes. The first byte is the number of sectors per track. The second byte
is the number of sides. The next 2 bytes are a 16bit integer, sent in
network byte order, signifying the number of tracks.

Note: Number of (sectors/sides/tracks) can be interchanged for the desired
(sector/side/track) value, in the case of reading/writing to a disk.

The BIOS expects side and track to be indexed from 0, and sector to be
indexed from 1.

#############
# RESPONSES #
#############

reqstat = 0 for failure, or 1 for success. All other values are reserved.

############
# REQUESTS #
############

There are currently 7 requests defined, their codes and functionality are as below.

################
# REQ 0 - QUIT #
################

This request should contain no data, and should be sent before closing the
TCP connection. The server will then allow another connection. The server
will not send a response packet to this, and is the only request to do so.

##########################
# REQ 1 - GET DISK COUNT #
##########################

This request should contain no data. The response should be 2 bytes in
length. The first byte is equal to the number of floppy disks present, and
the second byte is equal to the number of hard disks present.

##############################
# REQ 2 - GET HARD DISK INFO #
##############################

This request should contain 1 byte of data. This byte is equal to the drive
number that is to be queried for information. The drive number should be
indexed from 0, and should be less than the value returned from REQ 1.

The response will be 4 bytes, containing a CHS datatype.
The values returned in the CHS will be total counts.

############################
# REQ 3 - READ DISK SECTOR #
############################

This request should contain 5 bytes of data. The first should contain the
disk number. The next 4 should contain a CHS struct.

The disk number should be 0x00 for the 1st floppy, 0x01 for the 2nd floppy,
0x80 for the 1st hard drive, 0x81 for the 2nd hard drive...
This is the value that will be passed to the BIOS.

The response will be 512 bytes, if successful, containing the sector data
requested.

There is nothing in the protocol to stop you from trying to read beyond
the length of whatever disk drive is installed. If the BIOS fails reading,
however, this command will fail as well.

#############################
# REQ 4 - WRITE DISK SECTOR #
#############################

This request should contain 517 bytes of data. The first should contain the
disk number. The next 4 should contain a CHS struct. The next 512 bytes
will be the bytes to write to the sector.

The disk number should be 0x00 for the 1st floppy, 0x01 for the 2nd floppy,
0x80 for the 1st hard drive, 0x81 for the 2nd hard drive...
This is the value that will be passed to the BIOS.

The response will contain no data.

There is nothing in the protocol to stop you from trying to write beyond
the length of whatever disk drive is installed. If the BIOS fails writing,
however, this command will fail as well.

####################################
# REQ 5 - GET MAX DISK BUFFER SIZE #
####################################

This request should contain no data. The response should be 2 bytes,
interpreted as a 16 bit integer, sent in network byte order.

The response is equal to the maximum size of the disk buffer, and is the
largest number of bytes that may be read/written to/from a drive
using the READ/WRITE MULTIPLE DISK SECTORS commands.

Divide this number by 512 to obtain the maximum number of sectors you may
request.

######################################
# REQ 6 - READ MULTIPLE DISK SECTORS #
######################################

This request should contain 6 bytes of data. The first should contain the
disk number. The next 4 should contain a CHS struct. The last byte should
contain the number of sectors to be read.

The response will be (sector count * 512 bytes), containing the sector data
requested.

There is nothing in the protocol to stop you from trying to read beyond
the length of whatever disk drive is installed. If the BIOS fails reading,
however, this command will fail as well.

#######################################
# REQ 7 - WRITE MULTIPLE DISK SECTORS #
#######################################

This request should contain 6 + (sector count * 512) bytes of data. The
first should contain the disk number. The next 4 should contain a CHS
struct. The next byte is equal to the number of sectors to be written. The
next (sector count * 512) bytes will be the bytes to write to the sectors.

There is nothing in the protocol to stop you from trying to write beyond
the length of whatever disk drive is installed. If the BIOS fails writing,
however, this command will fail as well.
